### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a student of Computer Science at <a href="https://pwr.edu.pl/"> Wroclaw's University of Science and Technology</a>. I am currently  working on:
 - bachelor degree work about applications of supervised learning with imbalanced data. (currently project on refactor stage, currently I am preparing for exam),
 - refactor my script to webscrapp two certain webpages. 
 
What do I like to do in my spare time:
 - Automate things that I normally have to do manually.
 - Learn new things.
 - Play chess (Trying to achieve 1500 FIDE ranking until July - currently I have 1424).
 - read books (Currently I am reading Hyperion series by Dan Simmons).
