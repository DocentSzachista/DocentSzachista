### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a student of Computer Science at <a href="https://pwr.edu.pl/"> Wroclaw's University of Science and Technology</a>. I am currently  working on:
 - python script to webscrapp chess tournaments and display its data on a website or allow send information via emails.
 - bachelor degree work about applications of supervised learning with imbalanced data.

What do I like to do in my spare time:
 - Automate things that I normally have to do manually
 - Learn new things 
 - Play chess
